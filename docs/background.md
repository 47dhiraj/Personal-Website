I am always striving to  broaden my knowledge and sharpen my skills. I love working in environment with lots of challenges and brilliant people to share those challenges with. I am very passionate about programming. I have keen eye for new paradigms and architecture. Though I am comfortable in one language, I also like to explore new languages.

As a self learner, I started programming from mid of 2017, started from HTML, CSS, Javascript & then php (Laravel), Python (Django) and then i also started learning some ML stuffs(numpy, pandas, tensorflow). I also created Movie Recommendation System with Django & ML, created ecommerce web application, created Product Display System using PHP, created CRM system using Laravel also done some project planning system with react(redux) & firebase.
